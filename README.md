An AI based Video Assistant Referee for football (soccer)

## Introduction

Majority of football leagues around the world have employed a Video Assistant Referee (VAR) system to aid referees in making on-field decisions during football matches. However, refereeing has been marred by inconsistent decisions where certain decisions given in one game are not given in another. This project are my thoughts in how the refereeing system can be better quantified and made more consistent.
